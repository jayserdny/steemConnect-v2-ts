# SteemConnect V2 - Typescript Definitions

This is a wrapper of the [SteemConnect V2](https://github.com/steemit/sc2-sdk) SDK that is able to run smoothly in Typescript thanks to the typings definitions written in the project.

By using these definitions in a Typescript project, you can get the following benefits:

- Get the documentation for each of the methods
- Use the correct datatype in the methods
- Autocompletation of code.
